      "description": "Array of alarm configurations with different sensitivities. Each alarm independently monitors head movement patterns and triggers audio warnings when lookout requirements aren't met.",
      "add_remove": "To add alarms: Copy an existing {...} alarm object, paste it after the last alarm, and add a comma between them. To remove: Delete the entire {...} object and any trailing comma.",

        "min_horizontal_angle": "Total horizontal scan angle required (left + right combined). e.g., 45.0° means 22.5° left AND 22.5° right from VR center. Set to 0 or negative to disable horizontal requirement.",
        "min_vertical_angle_up": "Minimum upward angle from VR center to register an 'up' look (degrees). Set to 0 or negative if upward scanning not required for this alarm.",
        "min_vertical_angle_down": "Minimum downward angle from VR center to register a 'down' look (positive degrees). e.g., 5.0 means looking down 5°. Set to 0 or negative if not required.",
        "max_time_ms": "Maximum time (milliseconds) allowed without completing ALL required lookout directions before this alarm triggers. Recommended: 30000-90000 (30-90 seconds).",
        "audio_file": "Path to audio file (.ogg, .wav, etc.) for this specific alarm. Uses 'beep.wav' as fallback if file not found or empty string.",
        "start_volume": "Initial volume when alarm first sounds (0-100). Allows gentle start before ramping up.",
        "end_volume": "Maximum volume the alarm reaches after ramping (0-100). Should be audible over flight sim audio.",
        "volume_ramp_time_ms": "Time for volume to increase from start_volume to end_volume (milliseconds). Set to 0 for immediate full volume.",
        "repeat_interval_ms": "How often alarm repeats if lookout still incomplete (milliseconds). Minimum 100ms. Recommended: 5000-30000.",
        "silence_after_look_ms": "Duration to temporarily silence alarm when pilot starts a new lookout (milliseconds). This gives you time to complete the full scan pattern without annoying audio interruptions. Recommended: 3000-8000ms.",
        "min_lookout_time_ms": "Minimum time required between completing left and right scans for a valid horizontal lookout (milliseconds). Prevents quick head flicks from counting. Recommended: 1000-3000."

      "description": "Automatically resets ALL lookout progress flags when pilot looks straight ahead for specified duration. Prevents partial/stale lookouts from staying 'satisfied' indefinitely.",
      "window_degrees": "Angular tolerance around straight-ahead (degrees). Pilot must keep head within ±this angle from VR center.",
      "hold_time_seconds": "Duration to look straight ahead before reset triggers (seconds). Should be long enough to be intentional but not annoying."

    "condor_log_path": "Full Windows path to Condor flight simulator log file (typically 'Logfile.txt'). Enables automatic flight detection - alarms only active during actual flights. Use forward slashes or escaped backslashes."
